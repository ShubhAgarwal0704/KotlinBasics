// Constructors
// Constructors are used to initialize the properties of a class.
// Constructors are called when an object of a class is created.
// They have the same name as the class or can be named differently.
// They are called using the "new" keyword.

// Constructors are of two types:
// 1. Primary Constructor
// A primary constructor is part of the class header and it goes after the class name.
// 2. Secondary Constructor
// A secondary constructor is created inside the class body and it goes after the class name.
class Constructors4(
//Attributes - Properties
// variables that belong to the class
    var name: String,
    var year: Int
